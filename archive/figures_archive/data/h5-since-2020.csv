Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. There have been no movements of animals or products of animal origin from the establishment.  However, the pond is umaccessible for wild birds.
The establishment has been put under movement restriction . Killing and sampling of remaining birds is under preparation. Further measures such as establishing a protection and a surveillance zone are foreseen for the next days.

On the pond, 59 birds have been captured, killed and sampled. Subsequently, deterrent measures have been put in place in order to prevent incoming wild birds from settling. 24 of these samples have been tested positive for avian influenza in real-time Reverse-Transcription PCR on November 21, 2022.
The aviary has been isolated. All 60 birds have been sampled, laboratory results are negative. The aviary stays isolated and under clinical and laboratory supervision.
