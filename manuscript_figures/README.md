## Creating visualizations
This directory contains the data, code, and analyses produced for the manuscript below.

For Figure 3, Python was used. This directory contains scripts to train the embedding, create triples, and to visualize the results. 

For Figures 4-5, Jupyter Notebooks and QGIS were used. This directory contains an `.ipynb` file, organized with headings and sub-headings per figure. To run this file, install all package requirements using pip or your preferred package installer. You may need to restart the kernel to access the packages. 

If you wish to use the OpenSans font, install it [(here)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) to your system and configure the variable font_dir to your Font Library. Otherwise, comment this section out and your default system font will be used. No other modifications are required to run the script. 

The output figures will be added to the [`figures`](./figures/) file.
